# What is RAG ? Explain RAG in with a simple example.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a popular technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant external knowledge from a knowledge base before generating an answer. RAG improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and allows the model to provide more contextually relevant and up-to-date information.

As the RAG involves three steps namely: Retrieval, Augmentation and Generation.

**1. Retrieval** - In this step, the system searches an external knowledge source, such as a vector database to find relevant information based on the user query.

**2. Augmentation** - The retrieved information is then combined with the original user query to get the LLM prompt.

**3. Generation** - The LLM processes the prompt and generates a response, integrating both its pre-trained knowledge and the retrieved information. This results in more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

**(Imagine the image visually represents the 3 steps with icons and short descriptions for each – making it instantly understandable)**

**Example in Plain English (Cricket Edition!):**

1. **User Query:** "Who is the winner of ICC Champions Trophy 2025?" 🏏

2. **RAG Retriever's Find (Knowledge Source Dive):**  Imagine it digs up this gem:  *"The ICC Champions Trophy 2025...India emerging as the victorious champions...defeated New Zealand by four wickets..."* 🏆

3. **RAG Augmentation - Crafting the Perfect Prompt:**

    Prompt: "Answer the query based only on the provided context. If the answer isn't there, say 'I'm unable to answer".
    
    Query: Who is the winner of ICC Champions Trophy 2025?
    
    Context: [Insert the retrieved context about India winning the 2025 Champions Trophy here] 

4. **LLM Generation - The Winning Answer!**

**Output:** "India clinched victory at the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, triumphing over New Zealand in a thrilling final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium by four wickets." 🎉
