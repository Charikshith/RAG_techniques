# What is RAG ? Explain RAG in with a simple example.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a popular technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant external knowledge from a knowledge base before generating an answer. RAG improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and allows the model to provide more contextually relevant and up-to-date information.
