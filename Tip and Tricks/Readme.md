# RAG Optimization: Common Mistakes and Fixes

## Overview
This document provides insights into common mistakes that can degrade the performance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system and how to optimize it. It includes two key resources highlighting pitfalls and their corresponding fixes.

## Resources
| Title | Description | Link |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Is Your RAG System Scalable?** | Discusses how slow retrieval impacts RAG scalability and provides optimization techniques. | [Download](sandbox:/mnt/data/1740548481572.pdf) |
| **These 9 Mistakes Are Killing Your RAG** | Highlights critical mistakes in RAG systems and how to avoid them for better retrieval accuracy. | [Download](sandbox:/mnt/data/1740202681423.pdf) |

## Key Takeaways
- Slow retrieval is the biggest bottleneck in RAG systems.
- Optimizing retrieval speed improves user experience and engagement.
- Common issues include poor indexing, overloaded vector databases, and inefficient query processing.
- Fixes include ANN indexing, metadata filtering, caching, and active learning for continuous improvement.
