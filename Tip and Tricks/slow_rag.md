# Is Your RAG System Scalable?

## The Brutal Truth
Your LLM isn’t slow—your retrieval is.  
If retrieval lags, your entire pipeline fails.

### Why?
- Users don’t wait for slow responses.
- Every 500ms delay kills engagement.
- Scaling RAG without optimizing retrieval = disaster.

## Why Retrieval Gets Slow at Scale

### Key Issues:
1. **Bad Indexing**  
   - Naive KNN search doesn’t scale.  
   - Brute-force vector search slows down as data grows.  

   **What happens?**  
   - Every query scans millions of embeddings → response time skyrockets.  
   - Poor ANN selection slows nearest-neighbor searches.  

2. **Overloaded Vector Databases**  
   - Dumping more embeddings ≠ better retrieval.  

   **What happens?**  
   - Unfiltered queries search across all embeddings → wasted compute.  
   - Concurrent queries overload the pipeline → higher latency under load.  

3. **Inefficient Query Processing**  
   - Querying all documents at once increases latency.  
   - High-dimensional embeddings slow down nearest-neighbor searches.  

   **Impact:**  
   - Your system may seem fine—until query volume scales.

## The Fix: Optimizing Retrieval Speed

### How to fix slow retrieval:
1. **Optimize ANN Indexing** → Choose the right search algorithm.  
2. **Pre-filter Before Retrieval** → Reduce unnecessary query loads.  
3. **Cache & Parallelize Retrieval** → Prevent redundant fetches.  

### 1. Use the Right ANN Indexing  
- **HNSW** → Best for small datasets (<100K docs).  
- **IVF-PQ** → Faster for large-scale retrieval (millions of docs).  
- **ScaNN** → Optimized for extreme-scale systems.  

**Why This Works:**  
- ANN reduces search complexity from O(n) to O(log n).  
- Clustering (IVF-PQ) speeds up lookup time.  
- Graph-based search (HNSW) avoids exhaustive comparisons.  

### 2. Filter Before Retrieval  
Instead of searching all embeddings, filter before vector search.  

**How?**  
- Metadata-based filtering (category, date, user context).  
- Sparse retrieval (BM25) before ANN search.  

**Why This Works:**  
- Reduces retrieved document count → faster lookups.  
- Less computation = lower latency.  

### 3. Caching & Async Retrieval  
- **Cache Frequent Queries** → Avoid redundant retrievals.  
- **Asynchronous Retrieval** → Fetch docs while LLM processes responses.  

**Why This Works:**  
- Prevents repeated retrieval for common queries.  
- LLM doesn’t block waiting for retrieval.
